## TODO

Japan-O-Files is a relatively new project and, as such, needs some improving. We're looking into adding the following features/fix the following problems:
- Kanji lookup. This is top priority, and we'd love to make it happen soon. (✓ - as of 12/27/2015)
- Audio files. As of now, we make use of the Speech Synthesis API. We plan to (hopefully) change that.
- Format and minify (and beautify, maybe?) the code. Also, structure everything better. It's sort of a mess right now.
- Proper names dictionary.
- Improve our search algorithm. Really, it needs some improvement.
- Add a comments section (a forum, sort of?) powered by Disqus.
- And so much more...
